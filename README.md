# C++ Space Invaders Game (ARCHIVE)

A clone of the arcade game 'Space Invaders', with player movement, basic object pooling, and multiple types of movements that the enemy aliens can use.

Made in ~2 weeks for a university assignment submission, as part of the "Games in C++' module at UWE Bristol (BSc Games Technology).
